# Dijsktra-pathfinder

Dijkstra is an optimization algorithm for paths, represented by graphs.The algorithm has the ability to find the shortest path from an initial node to a final node, taking into account the cost of moving from one node to another.

## How does it work?

Using a grid, it is possible to build a graph that represents the possible paths between each cell, performing mazes, blocking steps, placing starting and ending points, the `Dijkstra` algorithm is implemented to achieve the shortest path between the matrix

## Features
- Make your own mazes
- Build random mazes with the game options
  - Few: A maze with 50 walls
  - Moderate: A maze with 100 walls
  - Many: A maze with 150 walls
  - Too many: A maze with 200 walls
